calculator
==========

Create a calculator that calculates strings.  Example: "one plus one".  Practice with Ruby and BDD (Rspec).

Start simple, and work your way to more complex, implementing these behaviors:

- Addition, e.g. "What is 5 plus 3?".
- Other arithmetic operators (subtraction, multiplication, and division). For division, don't forget about floats and integers!
- Powers, e.g. "What is 4 to the 3rd power?"
- Multiple operations, e.g. "What is 4 plus 6 divided by 2?"
- Multiple questions, e.g. "What is 2 plus 3? What is 7 divided by 4?"
